Unit 6 - Pythonic Monopoly

## Overview

In this assignment, we looked at real estate data in San Fransisco from 2010 to 2016. The final result is a comprehensive dashboard that shows the how real estate prices, gross rents, and housing units, have changed over time in San Fransisco and in specific neighborhoods.

## Technologies

In order to create maps and visualizations, I used various python libraries including Panel, Plotly Express, Numpy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib.
Panel visualations include Scatter Mapbax using Map Box API, Plotly Sunburst plot, interactive line charts with dropdown selection, interactive parrell coordinates plot and parrell categories plots.

## Findings

In San Fransisco, the number of housing units have increased year over year and we also see a steady increase in price per square foot and gross rent from 2010 - 2016 in the city. 
The neighborhoods that saw the most dramatic price increases were Union Square District, Merced Heights, and Miraloma Park.
